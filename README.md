Machine Learning Frame Work for Algorithmic Trading

We provide the libraries that we designed for Algorithmic trading in Khayyam ML, we call them X-Man. X-Man help you to strat your algorithm trading project fast.
We will add more Docs in future.


# IM: Investment Manager
This X-Man is the head, he makes a team from other X-Man and assigns task to them.


# YB: Young Boy
This X-Man is the youngest member in the team, he loves to learn but sometimes he is nerd. Please train him how to trade and never call him nerd, he doesn't like, he is intelligent. Machine Learning Costumed Algorithms are here, use them for speculation.


# RP: Retail Peddler
This X-Man trades a lot but each one in a small volume and with small or even zero profit but stable. He is like retail chain stores. Scalping and Commission maker algorithms are here.


# ES: Exiting Senario
This X-Man deals after you decide to buy a security. ES promises you that the security and the time you bought it DOES NOT MATTER, the volume is important. ES lives to help you to buy randomly and make profit. Martingale Algorithms are here.


# TSG: Technical Strategy Generator
This X-Man gets the names of indicators, their parameters and the way you want to use them via a dictionary then it returns the result. It works similiar to MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor Generator, but more general.
